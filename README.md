Python library to build pretty command line user prompts âœ¨

## Quickstart

To install `questionary`, simply use [pipenv](http://pipenv.org/) (or pip, of
course):

```bash
$ pipenv install questionary
âœ¨ðŸŽ‚âœ¨
```

Satisfaction guaranteed. Let's create a first question:

```python
import questionary

questionary.select(
    "What do you want to do?",
    choices=[
        'Order a pizza',
        'Make a reservation',
        'Ask for opening hours'
    ]).ask()  # returns value of selection
```

This will create the following list, allowing the user to choose an option:

### Different question types:

1. text
    
   A free text input for the user. 
    
   ```python
   questionary.text("What's your first name").ask()
   ```
   
   ![text](docs/images/text.png)
2. password

   A free text input for the user where the input is not
   shown but replaced with `***`. 
    
   ```python
   questionary.password("What's your secret?").ask()
   ```
   
   ![password](docs/images/password.png)
3. confirm

   A yes or no question. The user can either confirm or deny. 
    
   ```python
   questionary.confirm("Are you amazed?").ask()
   ```
   
   ![confirm](docs/images/confirm.png)
4. select

   A list of items to select a choice from. The user can pick
   one option and confirm it.
    
   ```python
   questionary.select(
       "What do you want to do?",
       choices=[
           "Order a pizza",
           "Make a reservation",
           "Ask for opening hours"
       ]).ask()
   ```
   
   ![select](docs/images/select.png)
5. rawselect

   A list of items to select a choice from. The user can pick
   one option using shortcuts and confirm it.

   ```python
   questionary.rawselect(
       "What do you want to do?",
       choices=[
           "Order a pizza",
           "Make a reservation",
           "Ask for opening hours"
       ]).ask()
   ```

   ![rawselect](docs/images/rawselect.png)
6. checkbox

   A list of items to select multiple choices from. The user can pick
   none, one or multiple options and confirm the selection.

   ```python
   questionary.checkbox(
       'Select toppings',
       choices=[
           "foo",
           "bar",
           "bazz"
       ]).ask()
