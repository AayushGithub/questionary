## Features 
Do you need to get command line input from a user? You need to check that they _really_
want to execute that dangerous operation, or select some options from a predefined list
or ask the user for an output file path? This library gives you the tools to write
effortless command line input prompts, enjoyable for you, the developer, and the
user.

## Installation

`questionary` can be installed using `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install questionary
âœ¨ðŸŽ‚âœ¨
```

## Usage

```python
import questionary

questionary.select(
    "What do you want to do?",
    choices=[
        'Order a pizza',
        'Make a reservation',
        'Ask for opening hours'
    ]).ask()  # returns value of selection
```

That's all it takes to create a user prompt! There are different types of prompts, 
you'll find examples for all of them further down.
