Python library to build pretty command line user prompts âœ¨

You need input from a user, e.g. how an output file should be named or if he really wants to execute that dangerous operation? This library will help you make the input prompts easy to read and answer for the user.

## Quickstart

To install `questionary`, simply use [pipenv](http://pipenv.org/) (or pip, of
course):

```bash
$ pipenv install questionary
âœ¨ðŸŽ‚âœ¨
```

Satisfaction guaranteed. Let's create a first question:

```python
import questionary

questionary.select(
    "What do you want to do?",
    choices=[
        'Order a pizza',
        'Make a reservation',
        'Ask for opening hours'
    ]).ask()  # returns value of selection
```

This will create the following list, allowing the user to choose an option:

## Documentation

1. [Different question types](#1-Different-question-types) 
   
   The available question types are [text](#text), [password](#password), [confirm](#confirm), [select](#select), [rawselect](#rawselect) and [checkbox](#checkbox).

2. [Styling your prompts](#2-Styling-your-prompt)

   Customize how your questions look.

### 1. Different question types

#### text
    
   A free text input for the user. 
    
   ```python
   questionary.text("What's your first name").ask()
   ```
   
   ![text](docs/images/text.png)
#### password

   A free text input for the user where the input is not
   shown but replaced with `***`. 
    
   ```python
   questionary.password("What's your secret?").ask()
   ```
   
   ![password](docs/images/password.png)
#### confirm

   A yes or no question. The user can either confirm or deny. 
    
   ```python
   questionary.confirm("Are you amazed?").ask()
   ```
   
   ![confirm](docs/images/confirm.png)
#### select

   A list of items to select a choice from. The user can pick
   one option and confirm it.
    
   ```python
   questionary.select(
       "What do you want to do?",
       choices=[
           "Order a pizza",
           "Make a reservation",
           "Ask for opening hours"
       ]).ask()
   ```
   
   ![select](docs/images/select.png)
#### rawselect

   A list of items to select a choice from. The user can pick
   one option using shortcuts and confirm it.

   ```python
   questionary.rawselect(
       "What do you want to do?",
       choices=[
           "Order a pizza",
           "Make a reservation",
           "Ask for opening hours"
       ]).ask()
   ```

   ![rawselect](docs/images/rawselect.png)
#### checkbox

   A list of items to select multiple choices from. The user can pick
   none, one or multiple options and confirm the selection.

   ```python
   questionary.checkbox(
       'Select toppings',
       choices=[
           "foo",
           "bar",
           "bazz"
       ]).ask()
   ```
   ![checkbox](docs/images/checkbox.png)

### 2. Styling your prompts

You can customize all the colors used for the prompts. Every part of the prompt has an identifier, which you can use to style it. Let's create our own custom style:
```python
from prompt_toolkit.styles import Style

custom_style_fancy = Style([
    ('qmark', 'fg:#673ab7 bold'),     # token in front of the question
    ('question', 'bold'),             # question text
    ('answer', 'fg:#f44336 bold'),    # submitted answer text behind the question
    ('pointer', 'fg:#673ab7 bold'),   # pointer used in select and checkbox prompts
    ('selected', 'fg:#cc5454'),       # style for a selected item of a checkbox
    ('separator', 'fg:#cc5454'),      # separator in lists
    ('instruction', '')               # user instructions for select, rawselect, checkbox
])
```

To use our custom style, we need to pass it to the question type:
```python
questionary.text("What's your phone number", style=custom_style_fancy).ask()
```
